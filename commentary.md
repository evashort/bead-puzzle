"Number of moves without thinking ahead" is calculated by a computer solving the puzzle 1,000 times. The computer tries to avoid moves that put it back where it was before, but otherwise it moves randomly.

In discrete math, a group of dots connected by lines is called a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)). The dots are called vertices and the lines are called edges. Each puzzle in this game is based on a different graph.

I wrote a program to generate every [connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_%28graph_theory%29) graph with at most 7 vertices and no [leaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)) (no dead ends). It generated
- 1 graph with 3 vertices
- 3 graphs with 4 vertices
- 11 graphs with 5 vertices
- 61 graphs with 6 vertices
- 507 graphs with 7 vertices

I removed most of the graphs because I thought they would make boring or repetitive puzzles.

I realized I could make every puzzle have the same goal state just by swapping the bead colors and rotating the puzzle.

[Graph isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism) has not been solved in [polynomial time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_(complexity)). In other words, there's no efficient way to check if two graphs have the same structure. Fortunately, these graphs are small enough that removing duplicates didn't take much computing power.

My program tries to arrange the vertices to keep the edges short, but sometimes it makes the graph structure unclear. I had to manually adjust the layout of this graph.

Nautilus: For some reason, this is the only puzzle with a state space containing less than half the possible bead arrangements (1/6 of them to be exact). It has 2 cycles of length 5 and one of length 6.
